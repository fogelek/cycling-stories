    <h2>Patrycja</h2>
    <p><strong>Road cyclist, mountain runner, Software Engineer</strong></p>
    <p>Hi, I'm Patrycja. I'm in my 30s, and almost whole my personality and private life revolves around riding bikes and running the mountains.</p>
    <p>When I was young, I was always the slowest and least sporty kid you could find at the school or on the playground. Couple of years ago I found my love in cycling, and little by little I've built my fitness to the point, where I can be proud of it.</p>
    <p>I want to invite you to share some of my trips, rides and runs with me. However, they may be not as impressive as ones of some people I know, I am proud of them. Each provided my with challenge, struggle, joy and happiness. Sit back and enjoy :)</p>
