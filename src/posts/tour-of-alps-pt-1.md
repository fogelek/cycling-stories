Every trip, every tour, every adventure starts with a dream. Dream transforms into a daring idea. And dreams and ideas have a tendency to persist, to slowly work their way into becoming a plan. This dream started about when I came back from my very first trip to Alps in 2021. I got but a small taste of what’s it like to cycle the big mountains. I got hooked instantly, and I wanted more. Way more. I started drawing routes. One-day trips. Big days in the saddle. But not having a car, and not being comfortable with driving at all I knew these were probably not achievable. I’ve shyly drawn my first route from Bergamo to Stelvio. And scratched it immediately. The idea of riding Alpine cols with luggage felt ludicrous at best. But year after year it was coming back, every time stronger then before. And one cold winter day I realized I really, really need to get back. I felt Alps calling me, and I just said... Fuck it, we ball.

The original idea was simple. Ride all the Tour de France bangers that I can put into a logical route. I’ve created original track quite quickly, and then… procrastinated with everything else to the latest possible moment. It was like I was subconciously afraid of pulling the trigger. I knew it was gonna be hard. Very hard. 700km. 19 000m elevation gain. With luggage. It was big, and bold. Not mentioning the logistics of flying with a bike. So I did, what I do best…. Created an alternative route. 800km, 20 000m climbing. Not an easier one, but perceivably easier, with climbs getting smaller towards the end of a trip, and with train access! No flying with a bike! I was super excited. I’ve planned the whole trip, split the route into days, found the preferred campsites, emergency campsites, researched food options, and… waited.

I’ve waited for so long, that roughly month before my scheduled departure I dived into buying train tickets in full panic mode. I’ve hit the web page, only to find out that… the trains I picked don’t have a bike car. I was left with options of either spending the whole night on the station in Vienna, both ways, or pay twice as much and have a layover of only 6 hours. Both ways also. Highly upset and resigned, I decided to check the flight fares. “No way they’re gonna be affordable that close to the date, just no fucking way”. But they were. After a rapid booking I came back to the “drawing board”. I pulled up long forgotten French route and started splitting it into days. 7. But I’m going there for 18 days… So the plan started to evolve, and I’ve let my imagination take the lead, indulging my FOMO. After few days, and endless hours spent in front of a screen, looking at the map, google earth, and reading about roads I could say “I am fully satisfied with how the plan looks, and I don’t feel need to add anything more”. Since I’ve got the tickets, the full length grew up to 1100km and 27km of elevation. Massive!

I’m not going to bore you with the rest of preparations, but I’ve meticulously planned where I want to sleep, I’ve weighed every item I wanted to take, arriving at around 10kg of luggage, and made sure I will be able to leave my bike case at the hotel for the duration of my ride.

## Prologue

The hills east of Turin proved to be a really fun place to get a unplanned warmup. After a really long trip that consisted of a night at the airport and a lengthy walk with a bike case that didn’t want to ride straight, I managed to get a VERY early check-in. A shower, rest time and one bike assembly later I had some time to kill before the real deal next day. What better way to do so then a small ride?

Not a lot can be said about it other than – I’m highly envious of Torinese cyclists. 7km climb starting just outside of the city center? I rode only a couple of roads closest to the city, but these were like younger, smaller cousins of the big climbs ahead of me. Just a small taste of fierce climbs coming in the next days.

## Stage 1 – Torino to Borgata

And oh boy, they came! But before they did, I had to get out of the city. This proved to be quite unpleasant part of the day. Despite Turin being beautiful, the experience of cycling through it I remember as pretty… haphazard. Bike lanes leading to nowhere, wave of red lights, drivers honking at everyone virtually all the time… daunting to say at least. I’ve happily left the city to indulge myself in an adventure. Track took me through Val di Susa, showing a couple of small, picturesque towns, quiet bike paths and short stretches of main road. Alpine giants loomed in the distance, growing bigger and closer with every mile travelled. Soon enough it was time for the main course of the day.

The idea to ride Colle delle Finestre on a road bike, with luggage, was peculiar to say at least. In reality, it was something between daring and crazy. 18 km of uphill at 9.3% average gradient, with top 8 km being on coarse gravel. I’ve heard people saying it’s not an easy feat even on a gravel bike. But being there and not trying… I wouldn’t be myself if I didn’t.

The climb starts with a bang, as 2nd km is featuring the steepest bits. But it’s not the maximal gradient that’s tricky here. Its it’s relentlessness. After the first wall gives a bit, it’s 9-11% all the way to the top. You just wait for the switchbacks in the forest, for once to give you some moments to breath on the outside line, and to borrow some shade. Sun, while better than rain, is merciless. Very quickly
